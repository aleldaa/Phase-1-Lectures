// Functions consists statements/tasks that return a value or undefined



// Function declaration
//Create a greeting function that returns


// Function expression
//To invoke a function call its name and use parenthesis



//create a greeting function that console logs a greeting


//console.log and return do different things
//console.log only logs something to the console
//return only returns the value of the function


//Function can take variables called parameters
//When the function is called, it is passed arugments that become the value of the parameter


//Create a function called squareNum
//that takes one parameter and returns the squared number of that parameter


//Function can take multiple parameters
//Create a function called addNums, that takes two parameters and returns the sum of those two parameters


//Whats another way to write a function?




//Arrow functions
// Arrow functions are shorter to write
// Arrow functions with a single parameter do not need parenthesis
//The benefits of functions are that they are reusable and can be called anywhere in your code


//create a arrow function that takes one parameter and returns your favorite food, assign it to a variable


//Functions are just like variables
//They can be passed into other functions, assigned to variables, and returned from other functions
//This makes them first class functions



// A function that returns a function is called a Higher-Order Function.
//create a funtion that returns a function



//A function that is taken as an argument is a callback
//create a greeting function, that take a callback as an argument and returns the callback



//Create a function called max that takes two numbers as arguments 
//the function should return the a string with the largest number
//if the numbers are equal, return a string that says the numbers are equal
